## Project Overview

**My-Python-Project-Template** is a Python project template designed to streamline the development of Python applications. It provides a structured setup with essential tools and configurations, enabling developers to focus on building features rather than setting up the environment.

**Key Features**:

- **Pre-configured Environment**: Includes configurations for code formatting, testing, and documentation.
- **Dependency Management**: Utilizes Poetry for efficient dependency handling and virtual environment management.
- **CI/CD Integration**: Comes with GitHub Actions workflows for continuous integration and deployment.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the development environment:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/canstralian/My-Python-Project-Template.git
   cd My-Python-Project-Template
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies Using Poetry**:

   Poetry is the recommended tool for dependency management. If you don't have Poetry installed, you can install it by following the instructions on the [official website](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).

   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

   This command sets up the virtual environment and installs all necessary dependencies.

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment**:

   ```bash
   poetry shell
   ```

   This activates the virtual environment, allowing you to run the project within its isolated environment.

## Usage

### Running the Application

To run the main application script:

```bash
poetry run python src/my_project/main.py
```

### Using the Library

To use the library functions within a Python script:

```python
from my_project import my_module

result = my_module.my_function(some_argument)
print(result)
```

### Running Tests

To run the test suite:

```bash
poetry run pytest
```


Ensure that your tests are located in the `tests` directory or follow the naming convention `test_*.py` for automatic discovery.
