## Installation

Step-by-step instructions on how to get the development environment set up. Be specific about dependencies and how to install them. Poetry is recommended for this project.

```bash
# Using Poetry (Recommended)
poetry install

# If you don't have poetry, install it first:
# pip install poetry

# Or, if using pip (less preferred for this template, but possible):
# pip install -r requirements.txt  # If you have a requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Instructions and examples for using the project. Provide concrete examples that users can easily follow. Show how to use the library or application.

```python
# Example usage (replace with your actual commands and examples)

# For running a script:
poetry run python src/my_project/main.py  # Or python main.py if in the poetry shell

# For library usage within a Python script:
poetry shell  # Activate the virtual environment if not already active
python
>>> from my_project import my_module  # Replace my_project and my_module
>>> my_module.my_function(some_argument)
>>> exit() # Exit the Python interpreter

# Example showing how to use the library functions directly:
poetry run python -c "from my_project import my_module; my_module.another_function('example')"

# Or, if you have a separate example script:
poetry run python examples/example_script.py
```
